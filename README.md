# Aircraft Safety Analysis & Business Recommendations

## Project Overview

 This project analyzes aviation accident data to identify the safest aircraft models for acquisition. The objective is to provide data-driven insights into aircraft safety, focusing on accident trends, manufacturer reliability, and fatality rates per model.

## Data Sources

### Aviation accident reports from verified databases
### Key attributes analyzed:
 Aircraft make and model
 Number of accidents
 Fatal and serious injuries
 Accident trends over time (1980-2023)


## Methodology

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Removed entries with missing aircraft make/model.

Standardized manufacturer names.

Extracted accident year from event date.

### Data Analysis:

Identified aircraft models with the lowest fatality rates.

Analyzed manufacturer safety records.

Evaluated accident trends over time.


## Visualization & Insights:

Count plots for accident trends.

Box plots for manufacturer safety comparison.

Bar charts highlighting safest aircraft models.



## Key Findings

Safest Aircraft Models: Boeing 777, Boeing 737 Classic, Piper PA-18.

Accident Trends: Declining accidents over time due to better safety protocols.

Manufacturer Insights: Boeing and Airbus models demonstrate consistent safety performance.



## Business Recommendations

Preferred Aircraft Models: Prioritize acquiring Boeing 777, Boeing 737 Classic, and Piper PA-18 due to their low fatality rates.



## Deliverables

Presentation Slides: Summary of analysis, visualizations, and recommendations.

Jupyter Notebook: Contains data cleaning, analysis, and visualization code.

Interactive Dashboard (if applicable): For further exploration of accident trends.
